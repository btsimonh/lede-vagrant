  # Local Machine Hosts
  #
  # If the Vagrant plugin hostsupdater (https://github.com/cogitatio/vagrant-hostsupdater) is
  # installed, the following will automatically configure your local machine's hosts file to
  # be aware of the domains specified below. Watch the provisioning script as you may need to
  # enter a password for Vagrant to access your hosts file.
  #

  # Private Network (default)
  #
  # A private network is created by default. This is the IP address through which your
  # host machine will communicate to the guest. In this default configuration, the virtual
  # machine will have an IP address of 192.168.50.4 and a virtual network adapter will be
  # created on your host machine with the IP of 192.168.50.1 as a gateway.
  #
  # Access to the guest machine is only available to your local host. To provide access to
  # other devices, a public network should be configured or port forwarding enabled.
  #
  # Note: If your existing network is using the 192.168.50.x subnet, this default IP address
  # should be changed. If more than one VM is running through VirtualBox, including other
  # Vagrant machines, different subnets should be used for each.
  #
  config.vm.network :private_network, id: "owt_primary", ip: "192.168.50.8"

  config.vm.provider :hyperv do |v, override|
    override.vm.network :private_network, id: "owt_primary", ip: nil
  end

  # Public Network (disabled)
  #
  # Using a public network rather than the default private network configuration will allow
  # access to the guest machine from other devices on the network. By default, enabling this
  # line will cause the guest machine to use DHCP to determine its IP address. You will also
  # be prompted to choose a network interface to bridge with during `vagrant up`.
  #
  # Please see VVV and Vagrant documentation for additional details.
  #
  # config.vm.network :public_network

  # Port Forwarding (disabled)
  #
  # This network configuration works alongside any other network configuration in Vagrantfile
  # and forwards any requests to port 8080 on the local host machine to port 80 in the guest.
  #
  # Port forwarding is a first step to allowing access to outside networks, though additional
  # configuration will likely be necessary on our host machine or router so that outside
  # requests will be forwarded from 80 -> 8080 -> 80.
  #
  # Please see VVV and Vagrant documentation for additional details.
  #
  # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080

  # Drive mapping
  #
  # The following config.vm.synced_folder settings will map directories in your Vagrant
  # virtual machine to directories on your local machine. Once these are mapped, any
  # changes made to the files in these directories will affect both the local and virtual
  # machine versions. Think of it as two different ways to access the same file. When the
  # virtual machine is destroyed with `vagrant destroy`, your files will remain in your local
  # environment.

  # /srv/config/
  #
  # If a server-conf directory exists in the same directory as your Vagrantfile,
  # a mapped directory inside the VM will be created that contains these files.
  # This directory is currently used to maintain various config files for php and
  # nginx as well as any pre-existing database files.
  config.vm.synced_folder "config/", "/srv/config"

  # /srv/source/
  #
  # If a source directory exists in the same directory as your Vagrantfile,
  # a mapped directory inside the VM will be created that contains these files.
  # This directory is used to maintain source
  config.vm.synced_folder "source/", "/srv/source"

  #
  # provison-pre.sh acts as a pre-hook to our default provisioning script. Anything that
  # should run before the shell commands laid out in provision.sh (or your provision-custom.sh
  # file) should go in this script. If it does not exist, no extra provisioning will run.

  #
  # By default, Vagrantfile is set to use the provision.sh bash script located in the
  # provision directory. If it is detected that a provision-custom.sh script has been
  # created, that is run as a replacement. This is an opportunity to replace the entirety
  # of the provisioning provided by default.

  # provision-post.sh acts as a post-hook to the default provisioning. Anything that should
  # run after the shell commands laid out in provision.sh or provision-custom.sh should be
  # put into this file. This provides a good opportunity to install additional packages
  # without having to replace the entire default provisioning script.
